#####yongchun(咏春):

[yongchun(咏春)] is a series chinese kungfu , it's one of the most fast chinese kungfu, so i named my django template plugin as [yongchun(咏春)], i designed it cause i want to use jinja2 like template inner django itself , if you want to use jinja2 in django you may use coffin or do some other hack,and other template based 3rd party plugin of django couldnot work under 3rd party template ,that's my opinions.
